## Some reflections
Why did I build this tool? I am in my second year of college in 2023-2024. But there was a disgusting thing in my college life. It\`s the morning reading. It was arranged in my precious sleep time and I don\`t like other people to take control of my time. So I found my headteacher to talk about it. But nothing worked. Of course, it also made me realize what kind of person my headteacher is.

It also made me realize one thing, students can\`t be united. Each student has his or her own pursuits, such as securing graduate school and getting money. Create trouble for those above is tantamount to threatening their own interests. Of course, there are some people who are just waiting, waiting for someone else to make a move, and then they make a profit in the back, and those losses are all borne by the people who came out. This reminds me of what Mr.Lu Xun said, studying medicine can only save the body of a small number of people, but cannot save the spirit of all Chinese.

My instructor, who used to be the rotating president of the student union,once said to me, if you think it\`s unfair and unreasonable and you want to change it, you should first climb to the position where you have that power. I\`m quite disgusted with this sentence. But in this environment, this statement is indeed very true. Of course my instructor is good and conscientious but due to environmental problems.

I think a good university should give students the freedom to study and give students the freedom to study. I just hope that will be the case in the future.

My English is very poor and thank you very much for reading the text above.
